# Image classification with ResNet50
Doing cool things with data doesn't always need to be difficult. By using ResNet-50 you don't have to start from scratch when it comes to building a classifier model and make a prediction based on it. This project is an beginners guide to ResNet-50. In the following you will get an short overall introduction to ResNet-50 and a simple project on how to use it for image classification with python coding.

Here I've Created a Program using ResNet50 to predict whether an image is of which Category. The model is trained using existing deep learning model i.e. resnet50. Also Ive uploaded the code on Kaggle.

### What is ResNet-50 and why use it for image classification?
ResNet-50 is a pretrained Deep Learning model for image classification of the Convolutional Neural Network(CNN, or ConvNet), which is a class of deep neural networks, most commonly applied to analyzing visual imagery. ResNet-50 is 50 layers deep and is trained on a million images of 1000 categories from the ImageNet database. Furthermore the model has over 23 million trainable parameters, which indicates a deep architecture that makes it better for image recognition. Using a pretrained model is a highly effective approach, compared if you need to build it from scratch, where you need to collect great amounts of data and train it yourself. Of course, there are other pretrained deep models to use such as AlexNet, GoogleNet or VGG19, but the ResNet-50 is noted for excellent generalization performance with fewer error rates on recognition tasks and is therefore a useful tool to know.
